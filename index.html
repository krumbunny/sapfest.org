    Community, volunteers, vendors, visitors and artists came together 
    for a (mostly) beautiful day. The SAP Library Association appreciates 
    everyone's enthusiasm and good cheer, and we look forward to sponsoring 
    another summer of children's reading program events, as well as taking 
    good care of our branch library.
