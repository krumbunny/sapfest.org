### The 2014 St. Anthony Park Arts Festival

The 2014 St. Anthony Park Arts Festival

This year the festival returns to the library: 
72 artists will be around and near the St. Anthony Park Library Lawn. 
Our featured artists are North Shore sculptors Dan and Lee Ross, 
Baltic jewelers Leo and Dina Lisovskis, 
and befitting a library, book artist Regula Russelle.
