### Website Details

<img class="bodypic rightpic" src="/images/SAPLibrary.jpg" >

This is a *static* website, meaning that all the the site's HTML is 
generated ahead of time and posted on a simple web host that just 
serves files, instead of running a program. Since there is no program
to break the core site is reliable and secure.

The web host for this site is [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). 
The cost to serve this site is less than $1 per month. 
S3 has been reliable for us.

The source for the site is written in HAML, SCSS, Coffeescript, Ruby
and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
The web site framework and generator [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/)
runs through a structured directory of these files and generates the 
site.

I happen to run Middleman on an [MacBook](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) running 
[OS X 10.8](http://www.apple.com/macosx/). I use SublimeText
to edit the source and
Panic's excellent utility
[Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) to upload the site to S3.
Most of the image manipulation was done with 
[Acorn](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) and Pixelmator.

The fonts are served from [TypeKit](http://typekit.com/). 
Click on the small Colophon badge in the lower right corner to see the 
fonts used on this site.

The artist online application service we use is the oddly named 
[Entry Thingy](http://www.entrythingy.com/), which worked well for last year's fair.

The web site author is Ken Chin-Purcell. Visit me at my studio - 
[Bungalow Pottery](http://www.bungalowpottery.com/).
