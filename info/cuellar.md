## Guillermo Cuellar

I fell in love with the potter's wheel in college.  Inspired by A Potter's Book, by Bernard Leach, and the clay traditions of East and West, I wanted to become a part of the historical sweep of this ancient and vital art form. I aspired to a good life as an artist potter, making pots for use, for preparing and sharing food. 

I came across the baskets, pots, weaving, and woodwork of native Venezuelan Indian people. Their beautiful objects, where utility and art converge in daily use, were a revelation. I loved not only the handwork but also the way these objects knit people together as a community.  The way the Indians relate to their art, close at hand and in constant use, remains an ideal to me. I believe exquisite beauty can be found in objects made for use.
 
A group of likeminded artisans and I founded “Grupo Turgua” dedicated to promoting good handwork in Venezuela. As an unexpected but wonderful consequence of this effort a community formed from the making, appreciation and use of our pieces.
 
Since 2006 I have found myself in the beautiful valley of the St. Croix River. The continuing discovery of this new setting feeds my soul and finds its way into my work. The trailed decoration on some of my platters suggesting the basket weaving textures of the Indians has evolved to the weaving meander of a river.
