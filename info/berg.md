Welcome to my world of millinery.  I have poured all of my creative energy into designing hats.  The basic elements are the same as any other creative endeavor.  Along with making my work beautiful, comes the challenge of making it wearable.  

I started out my career in design with clothing and then shifted to designing with leather for a number of years.  Working with leather involved large machinery and strength.  It was enormously satisfying but carried with it a lot of baggage.  When I moved to northern Minnesota and decided to get back into showing, I decided to jump in with fabric.  I was able to do everything with light weight machines and besides the space my piles of fabric take up, I didn't need an industrial sized space to do what I loved.

I now have a beautiful studio on our Arabian horse ranch. I live on a quiet country road and have nothing but gardens and peace and animals around me.  My life is inspiring every day.  I design for everyone.  My goal is to design work that is timeless and not trendy.  I pay attention to what is happening in the world and try to put current ideas in what I do, but also to work at the level of heirloom quality. Traditionally, hats were passed down through the generations and I know my work stands up to that test.
