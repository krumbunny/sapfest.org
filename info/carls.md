## Bob Carls

[<img class='featured leftpic' src='/images/past_artists/BobCarls.jpg'>](http://www.ripplerivergallery.com/Ripple_River_Woodturning.html)

*My work focuses on function or implied function, acknowledging the history of the vessel. I strive for continuity, historical context and a high level of workmanship as I make my bowls, jars, vases and vessels. I incorporate various woodworking techniques both on and off the lathe to accomplish this.*

Bob Carls is a full-time studio artist creating functional and decorative lathe-turned and carved vessels from the worldâ€™s most beautiful woods. He  brings to his work a lifetime of study in art forms that range from improvisational music to the visual arts, especially photography, sculpture and film. 

Turned woods vessels by Bob Carls can be found in the permanent collections of the Minnesota State Historical Society, St. Paul, MN; Waterloo Art Museum, Waterloo, IA; Waage Art Center, Fergus Falls, MN; and corporate and private collections worldwide.
