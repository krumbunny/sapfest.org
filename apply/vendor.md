## Vendor Information

If you are a returning vendor or want to see if there is an opening for you please fill out an application:

[Vendor Application Form](/apply/2014FoodApp.pdf)

#### Participation:

The fesitval date is Saturday, June 7, 2014. Last year more than 3,500 people 
from throughout the area enjoyed this family tradition, 
which includes an arts festival, kids' activity tent, family entertainment, 
sidewalk sales and more.

Although we have estimated the size of our crowd as between 3000-4000, it might be more. Last year, with good weather and improved publicity, the crowd seemed larger and a few vendors sold out of food. Just a heads up...

#### Process:

To participate as a food vendor, we ask that you complete 
the [application form](/apply/2014FoodApp.pdf) and 
return it and a $180 booth fee payable to 
*St. Anthony Park Library Association* to:

> St. Anthony Park Library Association  
> 2245 Como Avenue  
> St. Paul, Minnesota 55108  

Please note: You are responsible for obtaining your own permits 
and insurance. You will be asked for proof of proper 
documentation and you will forfeit your booth fee if 
your paperwork is not in order. Call the St. Paul Health Department 
to obtain your required permits. 

Also note that we are unable to refund fees or reschedule the festival 
in the event of bad weather. 
We regret we are unable to provide electrical power. 
Vendors may use their own generators. 
If you use a generator, we require that you supply a dog house to muffle the noise. 

You will receive confirmation of your booth reservation 
after we receive your application and fee. 
We will include in your confirmation your space assignment 
and other important information. 
Once you are notified of your space assignment, 
check the map on our website to find your exact location.

We will make every attempt to comply with requests for 
specific spaces; however, we cannot guarantee space assignments 
until we confirm your reservation.
We appreciate your interest in participating with us, 
and look forward to working with you.
