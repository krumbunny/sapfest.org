## Accepted Artists

This web page is for those artists who have been accepted 
to the St. Anthony Arts Festival, so from here on I will assume 
that includes you, dear reader.

We are looking forward to seeing you on Saturday, June 7, 2014!

Next steps:

### 1) Accept and pay for your booth

The booth fee is $115, and we need your payment by April 12 
in order to issue you a booth space. 
We have an informal appreciation dinner afterwards, 
which is included for yourself and a guest. 
Please let us know if you'll be coming and how many people ($5 per guest past the first).

Pay by:

### 2) Fill out [Form ST19](/apply/st19.pdf)

This is a requirement by the State of Minnesota to show that you are paying sales tax. 
The sales tax rate for the fair's location is 7.625%.

We need to have a [Form ST19](/apply/st19.pdf) for every artist, or we can be hit with a hefty fine. 
We've already filled out our event information in the version [here](/apply/st19.pdf). 

You can either email a filled out form back to us, 
or mail it to the address above, or give it to us on festival day.

We will be making sure on festival day that everyone has a form on file. 

### 3) Spread the word!

### Booth Layout:

We are working hard on creating a good layout this year, and 
I think you will be pleased with the results. We will be letting you know soon 
the general configuration for the 2014 show.

We will have a single page map handout and posted maps, as well as signs 
leading to the artist areas.

We will be letting you know some time in early May the booth assignments, and we'll 
update this page with the information then, along with more information on setting
up on festival day.

Let us know if you have any more questions.  See you June 7th!

More information is on the
[FAQ page](/apply/faq.html).
