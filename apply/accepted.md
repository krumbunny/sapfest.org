## Accepted Artists

This web page is for those artists who have been accepted 
to the St. Anthony Arts Festival, so from here on I will assume 
that includes you, dear reader.

We are looking forward to seeing you on Saturday, June 1, 2013!

### Fill out [Form ST19](/process/st19.pdf)

This is a requirement by the State of Minnesota to show that you are paying sales tax. 
The sales tax rate for the fair's location is 7.625%.

We need to have a [Form ST19](/process/st19.pdf) for every artist, or we can be hit with a hefty fine. 
We've already filled out our event information in the version [here](/process/st19.pdf). 

You can either email a filled out form back to us, 
or mail it to the address above, or give it to us on festival day.

We will be making sure on festival day that everyone has a form on file.

### Booth Layout:

We worked this year to create a layout that had good flow, 
with sightlines to other artists within an area. 
The blacks dots on the maps indicate trees. Each area has 40 artists.

We will have a single page map handout and posted maps, as well as signs and banners 
linking the two artist areas.

#### Luther Lawn:

We will not have a petting zoo this year (the operator pulled out), 
so we had an opportunity to take advantage of the level street and tall oaks on Luther Lawn.
The children's art activity (hats) and a collaborative weaving project are next to the Lutheran church. 
We also have the Luther Music stage where Phil Rukavena has organized a great line up,
including the Minnesota Mandolin Orchestra.

#### Library Lawn:

We created some circulating space at the Library this year along Carter Ave. 
There will be a new collaborative book project by Driftwood Community Arts across Como Ave., which is where the community groups and the Carter Ave. music stage will also be.

#### Booth assignments:

Below are the current booth assignments,
(also [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AgDmi2fYwdEAdDJPZkw4eTlyQllCMnZ5WUowcXBlaXc&single=true&gid=0&output=html)), 
along with an indication of which surface you will be on. 
g = grass, p = pavement, b = both (sidewalk and grass). 
We don't anticipate having to change this layout, but there is always the possibility a last minute 
cancelation which might force us to juggle a few spots.

#### Setting up:

- You can set up as early as you like on Saturday morning, 
which is when our permit begins and the streets will be blocked off. 
We will have volunteers to check folks in and show them their 
space starting at **7 a.m**.
If you want to come earlier the space numbers are painted on the grass and street.
The festival starts at 10 am.
- When you arrive on Saturday please check in at the information tables, 
located on the corners of Como Ave. and Luther Pl. and Como Ave. and Carter Ave. 
Let us know at that time if you will need help with set up 
or email us before the Festival. 
You should also pick up your packet, which will have:
  1. A small sign to hang at your booth
  2. A name tag
  3. The festival map
  4. An information sheet
- We will mark the spaces with paint.
- Once you have unloaded please move your vehicle as quickly as possible to avoid
congestion and to allow other vendors to unload. 
Both festival sites have parking nearby; 
if you are unclear as to where to park just ask at the information table.
- You are responsible for your own canopy and insurance.
- During the festival please let us know how things are working (or not) -
we value your feedback.

#### After the Festival:

- For those who pick up the stray bits of trash from the day and leave a clean space - Thank You! We appreciate it.
- The artist dinner is in the Milton Square courtyard, which is across Como Ave. from the library. It should start around six, although feel free to come sooner and enjoy a beverage.

### Previously:
