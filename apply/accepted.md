## Accepted Artists

This web page is for those artists who have been accepted 
to the St. Anthony Arts Festival, so from here on I will assume 
that includes you, dear reader.

We are looking forward to seeing you on Saturday, June 7, 2014!

### 2014 Getting Ready for the Festival

This year's [map of the festival](/info/Map2014.pdf) is available from 
our [press page](/info/press.html). There you will also find 
PDF's of our publicity postcards and poster if you want to use those 
materials in your own communications.

You should have been sent your preliminary booth space by email, 
but you might also inquire on festival day just to make sure there were
no last minute changes.

- Please fill out and send in [Form ST19](/apply/st19.pdf) if you have not 
  already done so. This is a requirement by the State of Minnesota 
  to show that you are paying sales tax. 
  The sales tax rate for the fair's location is 7.625%.

- You can set up anytime Saturday morning. Friday night set up is not available because 
  the space is used for another event. We will be on site by 7:00 am.
  
- The festival hours are 10:00 am to 5:00 pm. We will have some music starting
  at 9:30 am, and if all goes well we should have some coffee in the morning. 
  The music lineup in roughly traditional and classical in the morning, 
  acoustic and jazz in the afternoon.

- When you arrive on Saturday please check in at the information table, 
  located on the corner of Como and Carter in front of the Emily Program building. 
  Let us know at that time if you will need help with set up 
  or you can email us before the Festival. 
  We will have volunteers to check folks in and show them their 
  space starting at **7 a.m**.
  If you want to come earlier the space numbers are painted on the grass and street.
  We will have an 8.5x11 booth sign for you, an information sheet, and a 
  [t-shirt](/info/tshirt.html) if you ordered one.

- Once you have unloaded please move your vehicle as quickly as possible to avoid
  congestion and to allow other artists to unload. 
  The side streets should have ample parking, or you can park off street at the
  [Methodist Church Parking Lot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/2200+W+Hillside+Ave/@44.9794039,-93.1940403,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x52b32c914dce0d33:0x2cbed89eba3c6ef), 
  which is a block east on Como Ave.
  If you are unclear as to where to park just ask at the information table.

- During the festival please let us know how things are working (or not) - 
  we value your feedback.
  
- We will have booth sitters available mid-day.
  
- The after-festival get together should start around six and will be in the 
  courtyard and lower level of Milton Square, on the corner of Carter and Como,
  in back of Muffuletta Restaurant. If you didn't RSVP no worries - just let us know 
  when you can and you are welcome to join us.
  
- You are responsible for your own canopy and insurance. 

Let us know if you have any more questions.  See you June 7<sup>th</sup>!

### Booth Layout:

We are working hard on creating a good layout this year, and 
I think you will be pleased with the results. We will be letting you know soon 
the general configuration for the 2014 show.

We will have a single page map handout and posted maps, as well as signs 
leading to the artist areas.

We will be letting you know some time in early May the booth assignments, and we'll 
update this page with the information then, along with more information on setting
up on festival day.

Let us know if you have any more questions.  See you June 7th!

More information is on the
[FAQ page](/apply/faq.html).
