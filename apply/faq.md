## Artist Frequently Asked Questions

### Applications

Q: When are applications due?

A: Friday, March 14, 2014

Q: What is the cost?

A: Jury fee: $15 due via PayPal when you submit your online application.
Booth fee: $115 due within two weeks of being accepted.
Make checks payable to St. Anthony Park Library Association.

Q: What are the booth spaces like?

A: Booth spaces are 11 by 11 feet, on either grass or asphalt.

Q: How are applications juried?

A: Online applications to the Saint Anthony Park Arts Festival are peer reviewed. Considerations include:
1. Is the art handmade, and the artist’s own work? 
2. Does it show some element of artistry, originality and creativity?
3. Is a high level of craftsmanship apparent? 

Q: How many images can I send with the application?

A: Send 1 image of your booth, and up to 4 images per category. Each category requires its own application.
For example, if you have pottery and jewelry, send an image of your booth display, 
and four images *each* of pottery and jewelry.
Images must clearly display the items to be sold; 
images for jewelry and other small items in particular must have enough detail 
so that we can judge the quality of the work.

Q: What happens after the jury meets?

A: You will be notified as soon as possible after April 1st. 
If you are accepted, you will have two weeks to send a check or money order 
to confirm/save your spot in the Festival, 
or let us know if you are not able to participate. 
If we don’t hear from you, we will assume you are not coming 
and will reassign the spot. We do not refund for cancellations.

Q: I applied and was accepted. I have a friend who would like to share my booth. Is this OK?

A: Booth-sharing is allowed only if **both** artists have been approved by the jury. 
Bringing someone along who has not gone through the jury process 
will get you both kicked out.
You cannot add someone or unjuried merchandise after you have been accepted.

### Exhibiting at the Festival

Q: How can I help advertise the festival?

A: Digital and print copies of posters and postcards about the Festival are available,
just send us email. We will be sending both digital materials and cards 
to accepted artists. 
[Follow us](https://twitter.com/#!/SAPArtsFestival) on Twitter. 
[Like us](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Saint-Anthony-Park-Arts-Festival/229315300478251) on Facebook.
Pass the word among your friends and acquaintances - 
let them know we will again have music, and free hands-on art activities for all ages.

Q: When and how are spaces assigned?

A: Around May 1st booths spots are assigned, 
once we know which accepted artists are able to come.
Booth spaces are assigned to encourage diversity of 
vendors throughout the festival, and to facilitate crowd flow.

Q: How will I know where my space will be? Will I be on grass or asphalt?

A: Once you are notified of your space assignment, 
check the map on our website to find your exact location, 
and whether to prepare for grass or asphalt set up. 
(The map will be updated to the 2012 assignments, 
but it usually isn’t available until the end of May.) 
No space is perfectly flat, so plan to level your canopy and displays.

Q: How soon can I arrive to set up?

A: Spaces are marked out Friday afternoon, 
but do not set up until Saturday morning; 
our event permit is not effective until Saturday morning.
Some vendors arrive at sunrise; you won’t see our volunteers until 7 am or so.

Q: Should I check in when I get there?

A: YES! We will have the most current information/changes 
regarding booth assignments, plus you can let us know if you need help setting up.

Q: How far will I need to carry my stuff?

A: You can drive up to most spaces and unload. 
After unloading, you’ll need to move your car ASAP to a parking lot 
that is about a block away. If you need handicapped parking, help unloading, 
or special arrangements, let us know.

Q: May I bring my dog or other pet?

A: Not unless it is a seeing-eye dog. 
The area is packed with small children and other animals 
who may not be as well-behaved as your pet. 
If you have a special situation, call.
We try to be flexible.

Q: Do I need a MN Tax ID number?

A: Yes. Visit the Minnesota Department of Revenue
[website](http://taxes.state.mn.us/business_taxpayers/pages/business_registration_index.aspx)
and register for a tax ID number.

Q:  Can I use another state Tax ID Number?

A:  No, a MN Tax ID number is required to participate.
Call the MN Department of Revenue (651) 282-5225 or (800) 657-3605.
Or [register online](http://taxes.state.mn.us/business_taxpayers/pages/business_registration_index.aspx).

Q: Why does the Festival last only one day?

A: Because we’re all volunteers, and one day is all we can cope with. We love art, but enough is enough!
