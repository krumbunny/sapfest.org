## St. Anthony Park Arts Festival Mission

The festival is a benefit for our branch library.

The St Anthony Park Arts Festival is produced by the 
St Anthony Park Library Association, 
and raises both awareness of and funds for the 
St Anthony Park branch of the St Paul Public Library. 
The summer children's reading program is currently the main beneficiary,
bringing in and encouraging young new readers.

Each year the SAP Library Association appoints a festival organizer
and approves a committee to help run the fair. Financially and 
otherwise the festival is part of the SAP Library Association.

As the event names implies, the focal point of our festival is art. 
We also want to celebrate our library and involve children 
and community organizations. Festival participants are either:

- Artists
- Library supporters (book sale and garden sale)
- Activities (including music)
- Food vendors
- Community organizations

As a rule, only artists and vendors who have paid a booth fee 
should be accepting money. Our goal is to have as much of the 
artist and vendor fees (which are made possible by festival customers) 
flow into supporting the library as possible. 
The organizers seek out sponsors to offset festival expenses and 
volunteer all of their time so that more funds are available for library programming.

Art certainly isn't the only thing in the world to spend money on, 
and since our festival draws a large crowd there is often outside interest 
in putting a variety of other things on offer, 
including consumables like personal products and food products, 
services, charitable fund raisers, promotions and so on.
These items are often of high quality or for noble causes. 

Taken as a whole though this wide world of commerce would
overwhelm the festival. To begin with, taken as a whole, we
do not have the physical space to accommodate these requests -
we barely have enough room to accommodate the festival as is. 
We have also chosen to keep our benefit event centered on art, community and activities, 
In particular, we want to support the artists, 
whose booth fees make the event possible, by focusing the event on them.
