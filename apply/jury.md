## The SAP Arts Festival Application Process

The St. Anthony Park Arts Festival is a juried art fair. 
We appreciate the hard work and 
skill involved in making fine craft and art, and we aim to treat 
all applications equally and with care. 
Artists will be  judged by experienced art professionals on the basis
of their images and statement.

### Applications

We encourage you to apply! 
Applications and communication are mainly done through this 
web site and by email. 
Call us at 612-564-ARTS if you need to work by phone.
Applications start January 6, 2014.

All artists need to submit an application. Work must be hand made
by the artist. You need to be present on the day of the festival,
selling your own work.

The artist application consists of four images of your work and one booth
image. A short description for each image and a brief artist
statement, must also accompany your application.

Good images that show your work well are important.
Images should clearly display the items to be
sold; jewelry and other small items in particular must have
enough detail so that we can judge the quality of the work.

Each category requires its own application. For example, 
if you want to sell pottery and paintings, enter two applications.

**Note:** If the majority of the work you intend to exhibit is worn as jewelry
please submit your application in that category.

### The Jury Process

Our jurors are chosen based on their professional expertise and years
of experience working as an artist or representing the arts.

Images are projected one at a time in the order submitted while the
artist's statement is read.

After the artists are evaluated, the aggregate jury score is used to
rank artists within each category.  The jurors along with the show
organizers then decide the accepted and wait list groups in each
category.

Award winners from the previous year (4) and featured artists (4) are
pre-approved.

There are director's choice allowances in each category, 
up to 5% total for the fair.

### After the Jury

Accepted artists can withdraw before May 1 and receive a $90 refund. 
After May 1 our publicity materials go to press, our expenses become more fixed, 
and we cannot issue refunds.

### Costs

- Booth fee (if accepted): $115

- January 6, 2014 - Artist applications accepted 
- March 14, 2014 - Artist applications due

Thank you for being an artist. Without art and artists, how dull
living would be.
