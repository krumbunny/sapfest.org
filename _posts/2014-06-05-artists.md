I hand-paint fiber-reactive dyes onto a variety of textiles,
and draw with thread via my sewing machine.
The finished pieces become silk scarves, embellished clothing,
trapunto wall quilts, and one-of-a-kind greeting cards.

I am a functional and sculptural vessel maker.
My pieces are made out of clay and fired in a wood fire kiln for several days
resulting in both striking and subdued colorations.
The forms are simple to allow the firing to decorate the pottery.
