Mark Nuebel

Newport, Minnesota [http://marknuebel.com](http://marknuebel.com)

My work is metalsmithing and fabrication of mixed metal jewelry. I use traditional methods of cutting forging soldering and patination of a mix of sterling silver and copper. And all my jewelry is constructed using my handmade findings

I draw my State Icon illustrations digitally, using my mouse, at the tiny size in which they're displayed. They are archival-quality giclee prints that I make in my studio, and I finish them in simple frames that are handmade by my parents.

Vintage meets modern jewelry. I use deadstock and vintage components to design my work.  In my studio I drill, solder, stamp, hammer, and rivet to design my jewelry.
