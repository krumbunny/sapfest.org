Dan & Lee Ross

Hovland, Minnesota, [http://www.mnsculptors.com/dan.ross](http://www.mnsculptors.com/dan.ross)

We work side by side from initial design to the finished sculptures. Chisled granite and limestone combined with slab constructed stoneware clay are the materials we work with. Our ceramic work is fired to 2300 F. making it suitable for outdoor installations. Our stone sculptures are direct carved using chisels, diamond saws & grinders.
