The Arts Festival supports summer reading and activity programs, 
keeping thousands of children engaged in reading throughout the summer. 
Proceeds are also used to purchase equipment for 
use at the library and fund landscaping and building improvement projects.

The St. Anthony Park Branch Library was constructed in 1917, 
one of 3 Carnegie libraries to open in Saint Paul that year. 
The library is considered a focal point of the neighborhood.

The St. Anthony Park library was remodeled in 1985 and an addition was 
built in 1999 thanks to the efforts of the St. Anthony Park Library Association. 
The addition is a rotunda housing  the children’s reading room. 
This inviting space, combined with a juvenile collection 
funded through a bequest from Virginia Sohre, makes 
Saint Anthony Park a ‘destination library’ for young families, 
teachers and class visits from the neighborhood elementary school.

A park-like lawn with many benches invites patrons to linger with a book.
The gardens are maintained by volunteers from the 
St. Anthony Park Library Association and the St. Anthony Park Library Garden Club, 
and funded by the St. Anthony Park Library Association.

Because of its location on the western edge of St. Paul, 
nearly 30% of our patrons come from nearby Minneapolis and suburban Ramsey County, 
with another 25% visiting the library from zip codes outside our area. 
Materials circulation at the library is the 5th highest of all branches in St. Paul.

The library has an active non-profit Library Association which 
has served the community since 1934. 
The annual St. Anthony Park Arts Festival, held the first Saturday in June, 
is their major fundraiser.

Proceeds from the art festival support summer reading and activity programs, 
purchases equipment for use at the library and 
funds landscaping and building improvement projects.

The Saint Anthony Park branch library was recently featured in <a

of the Community: the Libraries We Love</a>, a book celebrating
beloved libraries nationwide.
