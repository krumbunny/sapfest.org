### Thank You

We look forward to seeing you on June 1, 2013!

Don't forget to:

#### 1) Fill out [Form ST19](/process/st19.pdf)

This is a requirement by the State of Minnesota to show that you are paying sales tax. 
The sales tax rate for the fair's location is 7.625%.

We need to have a [Form ST19](/process/st19.pdf) on file for every artist, or we can be hit with a hefty fine. 
We've already filled out our event information in the version [here](/process/st19.pdf). 

You can either fill out the rest in a PDF viewer (such as Apple's Preview) 
and email it back to us, or print it, fill out, 
and either email us a scan, or mail it to the address above, or give it to us on festival day.

We will be making sure on festival day that everyone has the form turned in. 

#### 2) Spread the word!

1. We will be sending you postcards to distribute.

1. Once accepted you will be listed on our web site: [sapfest.org](http://sapfest.org)
